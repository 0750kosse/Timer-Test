# Timer app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This React app has one page, with one component.  The Timer component displays the current time in the format hh:mm:ss.  Timer.test.js contains tests for the timer string starting with a default value and then containing something other than that value (assuming a time).

# TASK
Amend the Timer.js component file to add state variables, a function to set the current time string and another to do this at one second intervals.

# OPTIONAL
Add your own styling (an empty class **.timerStyle** has been created and you can add layout or other elements)

# Example UI

Run npm test (the two tests in Timer.test.js should fail, the test for App rendering should pass)  
Add your code  
Ensure that all tests pass
